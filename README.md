# Sprite sheet running animation

This was a small project I made when learning python/programming to get familiar with object oriented concepts and functional programming.

From a sprite sheet it generates a small animation, such as the running man animation below

## Running the code

* Install the dependencies:
  ``
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  ``

* Place your desired sprite sheet in the res folder (works best with running animations)
* Update the config file (config.py)
* Run the code, execute the main.py script from within the parent folder:
  ``
  python main.py
  ``
## To do:

* Use something more suited than pyGame
